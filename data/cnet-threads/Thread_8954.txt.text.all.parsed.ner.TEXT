<s> don't forget that you also need to install the sata drivers (or at least the instructions for it) from a floppy disk by pressing the f6 key during the initial windows xp install window....it will ask for the disk a little later in the installation and not immediately, so if you need to reinstall xp to that sata drive look for that.  </s>
<s> there are options also available to either install xp to the sata drive or do a repair which will let you install xp over the top of itself and leave your other files intact that are still there so if there's a chance of doing this, you might still be ok. there are some recovery tools that are freeware and shareway here: make sure you check to see which ones work with xp as some don't.  </s>
