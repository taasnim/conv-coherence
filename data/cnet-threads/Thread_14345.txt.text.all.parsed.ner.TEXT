<s> canon mp800/950 - seems to offer excellent quality but no adf, fax mp780 - excellent set of features but outdated hp 7210/7310/7410 - inks are too expensive others - so-so quality will there be an updated version of the canon mp780: a business-like multifunction with photo quality prints?  </s>
<s> i really want adf, if only the mp800/mp950 has that feature, or an add-on that can fix that.  </s>
<s> i already have a canon ip4000 and since the mp780 is built around that printer, it doesn't actually qualify as an upgrade.  </s>
<s> 1. the ip4000 and mp780 have the same printhead and carts so you can be assured that you can interchange them.  </s>
<s> 2. the mp780 is excellent in text and photos and solid in graphics.  </s>
<s> the mp800/mp950 is not much better, maybe faster.  </s>
<s> it does look sleeker.  </s>
<s> 3. the mp800 has the new nazi carts which means high quality carts from can't be used.  </s>
<s> you can still refill but it's turns off the low ink warning and writes a notice to the memory.  </s>
<s> also voids the warranty even though this is illegal in the usa.  </s>
<s> 4. the mp780 has adf and fax and cost less money, $200 on sale at officemax and: i would snag the mp780 it's the last of the v8.  </s>
<s> that's exactly it.. i'm looking for a printer (multifunction actually) that prints better than what i currently have.  </s>
<s> and since i'm hunting for a multifunction, it'd better have an adf, or better yet, and adf + fax.  </s>
<s> i just wish canon release a new multif.  </s>
<s> with an adf...  </s>
<s> the mp950 looks good and uses 7 carts maybe they will release a mp980 that has the adf + fax on it.  </s>
<s> i'm only guessing though and the mp950 is already listed at $449 so i would hate to see how much a mp980 model would be.  </s>
<s> i can't imagine canon wants their flagship to be the mp780 for very long.  </s>
<s> keep a watch on their site for the mp980.  </s>
