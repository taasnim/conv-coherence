<s> i've read a lot about both of these systems, and the majority of reviews are very positive. the price difference does not concern me.  </s>
<s> i am by no means an audiophile, and i'm pretty sure that the difference in satellite sound will not concern me.  </s>
<s> what i am most concerned about is the subwoofer.  </s>
<s> i primarily listen to rock music, but i do enjoy a little bit of everything.  </s>
<s> i know that the klipsch sub is able to hit lower notes, but does this actually mean anything?  </s>
<s> can anyone recommend one sub over the other?  </s>
<s> this system will travel back and forth with me to school, so durability and portability are also a bit of a concern, but i don't expect the speakers to be banged up.  </s>
<s> also any comments about any aspect of each product is really appreciated.  </s>
<s> none of the stores around me carry either of these products to listen to, and i'd have to drive about a half hour to pick up the klipsch...the z2300 is closer.  </s>
<s> i'm having a really hard time deciding, so any and all input is greatly appreciated!  </s>
<s> i haven't listened to the klipsch, but i've never been a fan of the brand - too much sizzle comin' out of their horn-loaded tweeters... but some people like that... :? i have the z-2300s, and i like them a lot.  </s>
<s> for computer speakers, they're great- they even have a semblance of a sound-stage!  </s>
<s> i don't think that you'll have to worry about low-end output - if you're going back and forth to school, i'm assuming that you're not going to be putting them in a very large room - you should easily be able to reach adequate sound pressure levels- as always, take a little care with the placement of the sub.  </s>
<s> oh, on the portability side of things... they're not very... the set probably weighs 40 lbs+.  </s>
<s> oh, and to directly address your question about the real-world difference in frequency response range of the two subs - the cnet review said that there was some distortion... i would take the sub with less distortion any day, even if it doesn't go as low.  </s>
<s> a good sub, that's setup well, will blend in with the main channels - if you close your eyes, you shouldn't be able to tell where it is, bass frequencies are omnidirectional.  </s>
<s> distortion kills that illusion.  </s>
<s> that, and the fact that you probably wont miss that frequency range anyway (unless you listen to pipe organs!), would make me lean towards the z-2300s  </s>
<s> i really appreciate the information you've provided, thanks.  </s>
<s> definitely going to check out the z2300s.  </s>
<s> now do you have specific advice on sub placement?  </s>
<s> or somewhere to find out about that stuff?  </s>
<s> in a nutshell - front of the room, near (but not in!) a corner or wall.  </s>
<s> not-so-nutshell - if you have enough cable, place the sub where you would normally listen.  </s>
<s> play something with at least somewhat musical bass.  </s>
<s> walk around near the front of the room slowly, listening to the changes in the quality of the bass - bass frequencies/waves are long, as such very dependant on room shape, size and location within that space- it'll sound different at point a than it will at point b, even if they're only a foot apart.  </s>
<s> so, on your walkabout, you'll find a place where it sounds best - good oomph, but not too bloated and boomy - that's where you want to put the sub.  </s>
<s> again, pay particular attention to the areas to the front of the room, near a corner or wall, but never up against one.  </s>
<s> also, never put a sub at the halfway point between opposite walls - the waves will reflect and tend cancel each other out.  </s>
<s> after you get the sub placed, fiddle with the sub volume 'til it matches what's coming out of the l&r speakers (the z-2300 has a bass volume knob in addition to the master volume on the wired control).  </s>
<s> if you really want to get the most out of them (hehhehheh) go to radioshack and get a $30 sound pressure level (spl) meter and a test disc and balance along the frequency range to your heart's content!  </s>
<s> i should clarify - when i say to place the sub where you would normally listen, i mean, where you, yourself, would be when you're listening - if you would most likely sit 2 feet in front of the computer when listening, put it there.  </s>
<s> if you're going to listen more from the edge of your bed, put it there, etc.  </s>
<s> great stuff, can't thank you enough for the info!  </s>
