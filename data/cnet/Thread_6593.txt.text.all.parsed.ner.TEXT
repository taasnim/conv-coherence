<s> i have 2 new dell computers in my home which my brother purchased for me through dell's small business division.  </s>
<s> one computer is an inspiron 1300 notebook and the other computer is a dell dimension e510.  </s>
<s> last night i contacted dell's tech support about a problem with the inspiron 1300 notebook.  </s>
<s> i was surprised to receive an answer from a tech support rep who claimed to be located in the state of alabama although the rep claimed to be a resident of massachusets(sp?) who i was able to understand very clearly.  </s>
<s> i was expecting my call to be routed to either india; the phillipines; or some other foreign land.  </s>
<s> the tech support rep told me that my call was routed to him because my computers were purchased from dell's small business division and all tech support calls on sbd dell's were answered by u.s. based techs.  </s>
<s> if the computers in question had been purchased from dell's home office division my call would have been routed to india.  </s>
<s> i then asked if i purchased a dell xps computer; be it an xps notebook or a desktop; where would my tech support calls be routed? the tech support rep based in alabama informed me that all tech support calls on any dell xps computers were also handled here in the usa and not forwarded overseas.  </s>
<s> is this information correct or not?  </s>
<s> my tech support session last night with the rep based in alabama went very smooth and my problem was also solved quickly.  </s>
<s> i know dell gets bashed in many forums; one chief complaint is their overseas based tech support.  </s>
<s> i have problems understanding those tech support reps in india but i'm certainly trying.  </s>
<s> my internet service tech support for my dsl with bell south is also based in india and there are times where i find it very difficult to communicate with india.  </s>
<s> i'll have to say that last night's tech support session with the dell rep in alabama was refreshing and certainly not frustrating to say the very least not to mention that my problem was also resolved very quickly.  </s>
<s> i was communicating with someone who i could definitely understand.  </s>
<s> feedback from anyone in the know would certainly be appreciated if they've had similar experiences with dell's tech support for small business machines or xps computers.  </s>
<s> big steve 05/14/06  </s>
<s> yes, you are correct!  </s>
<s> i have run across this also.  </s>
<s> small/medium/and large business and higher end home purchases tech support has been moved to the us - or at least that's what i've come across.  </s>
<s> i am an it consultant and one of my clients has a pc purchased through a small business plan and my tech call went to someone claiming to be in alabama.  </s>
<s> another client bought a pc directly from dell home and my call went to someone with a very thick accent - they claimed to be in chicago, but i am relatively certain they were located in india.  </s>
<s> good move for dell as far as i am concerned.  </s>
<s> big steve, i have had no success with dell call center.  </s>
<s> they have always been out of the country.  </s>
<s> i order a new notbook this year and requested they look at my 2003 computer and give me another computer with faster speed,more memory and 4 to six usb ports.  </s>
<s> computer was not support to be delivered until i returned from my trip.  </s>
<s> computer was delivered early.  </s>
<s> nevertheless my 30 day trial was over.  </s>
<s> computer was not what i ordered.  </s>
<s> no way to return.  </s>
<s> i may several calls trying to talk to someone but for get that.  </s>
<s> some letters came back.  </s>
<s> one letter is still out there.  </s>
<s> no good news about dell.  </s>
<s> now they are on my &quot;w&quot; list and i'm seeking legal action.  </s>
<s> the good new is i can file small claims.  </s>
<s> i do not recommend dell.  </s>
<s> thanks for your post.  </s>
<s> do you personally know if xps products also receive usa support; be they purchased from dell's small business unit or dell's home office unit?  </s>
<s> if you don't know would it be safe to say if there is any doubt to go ahead and configure something and purchase it from dell's small business unit and to steer clear of dell's home office unit?  </s>
<s> feedback again will be appreciated.  </s>
<s> big steve 05/14/06  </s>
<s> hi, so this has been talked about on the dell community forums and many of us who are home xps customers have called into tech support with the xps dedicated tech phone number and received very satisfying support.  </s>
<s> from what i can tell looking over the business sections, dell also sells xps systems through the business side too and they might have the tech support based here in the states.  </s>
<s> either way, the support is there and whenever i need to speak to a senior tech, i get one.  </s>
<s> just more feedback and i hope it adds more to this post.  </s>
<s> guardian  </s>
<s> no steve, i'm sorry.  </s>
<s> i don't know for sure that xps support is based in the us.  </s>
<s> i was told that through a rep i spoke with in alabama so i would say that yes, buying through a business account would probably be best if your main concern is support.  </s>
<s> but be aware, dell does not offer the &quot;deals&quot; they offer through their home unit on most business purchases.  </s>
<s> sure, you can still get a pretty good deal if you watch the sales, but i have found (though i can't say all the time, or that i really pay that much attention to it unless i'm in the market for something) that the home prices are usually better - or you get something better with your purchase.  </s>
<s> i recently bought a media center pc (decent upgrades, but nothing crazy - i'd rather upgrade it myself later anyway) for my home for less than $850 including tax, shipping, etc. and i got a free 19&quot; monitor. the same configuration from dell small business was over $900 without the monitor.  </s>
<s> ofall  </s>
<s> i've dealt with various tech supports over the years and can only say, &quot;take everything with a grain of salt&quot; because it could all change on the next call.  </s>
<s> if anyone complains about this or that, it certainly suggests things have gone awry.  </s>
<s> dell, has defeinetly been hit by the india outsourced tech support and its not necessarily the actual support answers but the &quot;english speak&quot; side of things, us customers really fall down on getting it across.  </s>
<s> on top of that the sop supply side of answers can be so dibble until you get into real solution area, finally after wasted time(to many users).  </s>
<s> but, heck that's what keeps me in business a friendly face and solutions right here on the usa shores and in-home.  </s>
<s> tada -----willy  </s>
<s> so often we b*tch when we get bad service, but rarely do we let folks know when things went right.  </s>
<s> its refreshing.  </s>
<s> i would probably consider having my brother purchase a dell pc through dell's small business division for me through his company if i could be assured that all future tech support sessions on any future dell computer purchased from dell's small business division would be as smooth and hassle free as my session was a few nights ago with dell's small business division's tech support rep based in alabama.  </s>
<s> tech support; although some don't consider it to be very important; although i might get lucky and never need it; it's something very important to me to have good tech support with whichever vendor i myself would decide to purchase from and especially being able to also deal with someone who won't create or cause any language barrier problems to add to any frustration that i might encounter when dealing with any computer company's tech support.  </s>
<s> thanks for your comments.  </s>
